# whatsapp_automation
HiMart focuses a lot on building good rapport with our customers. Using Whatsapp as the base form of communication, there are many messages that can be automated to make the customer experience better, and make the lives of group leaders better! I created this automation system to generate product lists sent via Whatsapp.

### Installation & Preparation ###
First, install `chromedriver`. Place it into this folder. Else, change the `driver_path` to its full path where `chromedriver` is installed.

Next, create the folder `User_Data`. This folder is meant to retain your Whatsapp login information such that you only need to scan your QR code the first time.

Lastly, make sure all the dependencies are installed.

### GUI using Tkinter ###
